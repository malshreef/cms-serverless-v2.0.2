# Insights page added

Framework detection:
- Next.js: True
- Vite: True
- Uses React Router: True
- TypeScript present: False

Created file:
- pages/insights.tsx

If React Router is used, I attempted to auto-wire a route `/insights` in `/mnt/data/workspace/src/App.jsx`.
If it's a Next.js project, the page is available at `/insights` automatically.

This page uses **Recharts** and **Tailwind-like classes**. Ensure the project has Tailwind (optional) and install Recharts:
```
npm i recharts
```
